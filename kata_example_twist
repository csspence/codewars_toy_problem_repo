/*
This is an easy twist to the example kata (provided by Codewars when learning how to create your own kata).

Add the value "codewars" to the array websites/Websites 1,000 times.

var websites = []
*/

var websites = []


const addThem = (array) => {
  let counter = 0;
  while(counter < 1000) {
    array.push('codewars');
    counter++;
  }
  return array;
};

addThem(websites)

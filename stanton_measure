/*
The Stanton measure of an array is computed as follows: count the number of 1s in the array. Let this count be n. The Stanton measure is the number of times that n appears in the array.

Write a function which takes an integer array and returns its Stanton measure.

Example
The Stanton measure of [1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2] is 3, because 1 occurs 2 times in the array and 2 occurs 3 times.

const stantonMeasure = (array) => {
  let n = 0;
  let stanton = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if(array[i] === 1) {
      n++;
    }
  }
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if(array[i] === n) {
      stanton++;
    }
